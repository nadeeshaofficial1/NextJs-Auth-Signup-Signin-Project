The <b>"Next.js Sign and Sign Up Project"</b> is a web application designed for user authentication and administration, built with Next.js, ShadCN UI library, and Tailwind CSS. It supports user registration, login, admin dashboard access, and logout features. Supabase, an open-source Firebase alternative, is used for real-time database management and storage. Prisma serves as the ORM, ensuring efficient and type-safe database interactions. User data is securely stored in Supabase upon registration, and the login system verifies credentials for access to the admin dashboard. This project demonstrates a modern, efficient approach to building user authentication systems with a robust backend.
